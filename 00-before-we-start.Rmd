# Before we get started

* Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -below- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder, and choose a convenient location for
  it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day
  (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory.
  (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/data`)
* Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `data-carpentry-script.R`)

Your working directory should now look like this:

## Organizing your working directory

Using the same folder structure across your projects (working directory) will
help keep things organized, and will also make it easy find/file things in the
future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In
general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and
**documents**.

 - **`data/`** You should separate the original data (raw data) from
  intermediate datasets that you may create for the need of a particular
  analysis. For instance, you may want to create a `data/` directory within your
  working directory that stores the raw data, and have a `data_output/`
  directory for intermediate datasets and a `figure_output/` directory for the
  plots you will generate.
 - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, text.
 - **`scripts/`** This would be the location to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your
   functions (more on that later!)

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. For this
workshop, you only need a `data/` folder.

# Presentation of RStudio

Let's start by learning about our tool.

* Console, Scripts, Environments, Plots
* Code and workflow are more reproducible if we can document everything that we
  do.
* Our end goal is not just to "do stuff" but to do it in a way that anyone can
  easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results.

# Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or
*code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer
and we can understand. We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the
computer to follow the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those
commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code).

The console window (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where R is
waiting for you to tell it what to do, and where it will show the results of a
command that has been executed.  You can type commands directly into the console
and press `Enter` to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you
close the session. It is better to enter the commands in the script editor, and
save the script. This way, you have a complete record of what you did, you can
easily show others how you did it and you can do it again later on if needed.
Rstudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the `Ctrl-Enter` shortcut. The command on the current line in the script or all
of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and
executed when you press `Ctrl-Enter`.

At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of variable or
the structure of an object, without necessarily keep a record of it in your
script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console.
RStudio provides the `Ctrl-1` and `Ctrl-2` shortcuts allow you to jump between
the script and the console windows.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it
receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using
`Ctrl-Enter`), R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and
come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet,
the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. If
you're in Rstudio and this happens, click inside the console window and press
`Esc`; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.

# Basics of R

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both
for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Free/Libre/Open Source Software under the GPL.
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000
  user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and
  industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* For people who have experience in programmming: R is both an object-oriented
  and a so-called [functional language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).
* Large and growing community of peers.
